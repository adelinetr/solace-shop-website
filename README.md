Here's the React made website for e-commerce clothing shop named 'Solace'. It's one of the last and most progressive projects that I've made, since I included more functions to make this website more visually appealing and functional. 

## Purpose of the project:
- Create a website using my UI/UX knowledge and understanding of design principles
- Create a brand website from zero: concept, logo, moodboard, choice of images that best represent it, wireframe and the website itself
- Introduce myself to a full project creation in React
- Experiment with various functions to make website more interactive 
- Learn more about how to use hooks of React more effectively
- Practice React Router to switch between pages

## Step By Step
Here is the representation of the brand specifics: Main Palette of Colors, Font Choice, Concept of the Brand and Moodboard.

Shorthly: The visual mood of this brand was meant to be focused around minimalism to reflect simplicity and sophistication of the brand. One of the things I would do differently looking at this project over time - is not to include Josefin Sans. It's too bold and rough compared to other 2 fonts that are more appealing and have soft feeling to them.

## Wireframe of the website
- Wireframe helps to see an approximate planning of the content and its layout. Some minor changes I added while creating the website. All of it is neccecary for having a consistent visual hierarchy.

## Functions I've used in React

### Scroll-Responsive Navigation
- To make it easier to navigate across the website, I decided to make a fixed navbar that follows user on the wide screen as well
